                        <p>
                            Volunteering has been my passion right from school and working at Infosys has helped develop that interest further. Working with the community to facilitate a larger social development is part of the Infosys culture and this has been deeply ingrained in the ethos of the corporation and amplified through actions championed by the leaders themselves. The Team of Samarpan (CSR Wing of Bangalore DC, Infosys) provides a platform for employees to engage in volunteering at the DC level. Samarpan has great potential and the promise of nurturing responsible citizens for tomorrow who will fuel sustainable change. My association with Samarpan as a volunteer over the last eight years has been a life-changing experience and denying the comfort and luxury of home to volunteer to distant places that require timely help provides an exhilarating and overwhelming exposure. Being a volunteer has always helped me make new friends and expand my social network and has given me the opportunity to practice and develop social skills. It has also given me a deep sense of purpose and has increased my self-confidence. I have been part of many projects and I talk about couple of them below. </p>

                            <p>‘Parishudha’ is Project driven towards improving sanitary solutions in villages. This is an Infosys foundation initiative supported by our Samarpan group. Open defecation is a problem that must be addressed aggressively across the entire nation and today, this initiative is a success story that holds the promise of a cleaner, healthier India. Infosys’ professional approach to this initiative has made it easier for other organizations to step in and replicate this model of working with local communities to achieve fixed goals. With this initiative, more than 10,000 families have constructed toilets in five districts of Northern Karnataka; Gulbarga, Bidar, Yadgir, Koppal and Raichur. The Parishudha initiative has won praise and recognition from several quarters and the Infosys team was invited to share their best practices with the state governments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the Government of India, the United Nations Developmental Program and several other forums. From the start, the aim of the program was to make this initiative easily replicable, so that communities across India can adapt and implement such measures and achieve 100% sanitation.

                        	<p>Gnanadeepa is an initiative from Infosys Science foundation supported by Samarpan group. This initiative will inspire and enable teachers to engage with students, generate curiosity and promote experimental teaching rather than just text book learning. The response to the program has been phenomenal and the outcome of this initiative led Samarpan to drive ‘science kit donation program’ independently. Today, more than 10,000 students from 6 districts of Karnataka have benefited from this initiative and through the Rural Reach Program and PC Donation Program, we have reached more than 2,50,000 government school students in rural areas across the state. Via volunteering, we enable them to use computers to advance their academic aspiration.</p>

                        <p>While there are many initiatives that I have been an active volunteer of and some that I have led, the few mentioned above have been remarkable in quality & in quantity. I’d also like to mention that volunteering in these initiatives has ensured interaction with great leaders and policy makers including my role model, Dr. A.P J Abdul Kalam. </p>

                        <p>Apart from CSR activities through Samarpan, I have also been an active volunteer in Petit Infoscion Day, Safety week, Sarige Samillana, Security Samillana, Space council- Facility Team Neta Connect, Green Connect, Transport Team, and a Member of Voice of Youth from past 8 years. This is your chance to make a difference. Do come and volunteer, you are needed.</p>

                            All fingers are not of equal in length, similarly every individual is not equal. Some are more blessed, but some are not so fortunate. So I believe it becomes our responsibility to provide them a helping hand, help them when there is a need, and never say no for any help. When we talk about volunteering - word itself means self-motivation (bringing that responsibility of work from within).</p>

                            <p>I really don’t know when I started volunteering because I have always been helpful whenever there has been a need. Joining Infosys gave me much bigger platform to contribute, be it in project, unit level, and organization level or to larger society.</p>

                            <p>Volunteering need not always be a big contribution to a large section of people! It could just be going extra mile in helping your colleagues in project, joining hands to ramp up new joinees in the team, managing team activities, outing and many other initiatives which help the team stay together as a family. I am the part of Fun team at my unit – any festival, any occasion we plan together for a fun related activity and manage to bring smiles for my fellow employees. I conduct CSR activities by way of voluntary participation of employees and contributing some monetary help towards some NGO or for some good cause. I help HR folks to conduct employee engagement activities and many more activities which bring together my unit as a strong family. This helps in creating strong bonds between each team. And all this comes with just mere volunteering and working towards making this place good. I have been successfully conducting unit level meetings from past 4 years. Such volunteering is stepping stone for larger contributions and has prepared me for bigger events at Development Center (DC) or organization level managing up to 30K people!  </p>

                        	<p>Infosys has provided platform to contribute to larger section of society through Bangalore DC CSR wing - Samarpan from past 4 years. I volunteer in almost all activities and try to contribute towards betterment of our society. My most favorite drive is Blood donation drive which we conduct in campus, with god's grace I am successfully in managing this from past 8 drives and have almost collected 2900+ units of blood. This has helped hospital in saving lot of lives. In fact, it helps our Infoscions and their families during emergency. And I feel so happy with this. Recently my team from Samarpan was featured in "Humans of Bangalore" edition. I help in various activities like Science kit donations, Computer donation, Rural Reach Program, Eye screening programs, Emergency situations like Chennai floods, Drought hit areas, etc.</p>

                        <p>All these contributions have given me much more than what I have offered. It brings so much satisfaction to see my contributions bringing happiness to life of so many people. I am able to take this energy back to my work and exceed expectations at work as well!. With support from the great team and platform that we have, looking forward to greater contributions. </p>

                            Hey, this is Shruthi Venkat an engineering student by brain and an artist by heart. I've lately started volunteering in Bettadasanapura govt school. I exactly don't remember when the thought of volunteering came to me. It was an impulsive decision as working for a social cause ran in my blood. </p>

                            <p>I have a good hand in painting and have developed an unique style with colors. As I started making more and more paintings, my techniques with colors underwent changes and finally had what people say a "knack" that made my paintings outstanding.</p>

                            <p>After I developed my own style and had something new to teach others, I started teaching kids in my neighbourhood. It was more for pocket money though but it struck me that I should be teaching the disadvantaged, the souls who need a trade to earn their bare minimum necessities and to those tiny souls who might inspire many kids like them to aspire for greater heights. </p>
                            <p>
                            	However I thought I should wait till I earn to help others but it turned out that destiny had other plans. There was a call in our apartment forum by a fellow resident to volunteer for the local govt school. I was elated and didn't waste a second to enrol myself there. That's how I found my budding Picassos and started teaching them to fish their own food, just what my inner soul wished for.

                        	<p>The start wasn't easy, when a college girl walked in saying, "hey, this is your art teacher", there were few raised eyebrows and adding to it, I didn't know the local language.  had difficulties communicating with kids. But then as prevalent as it is, good intentions always find a path on their own. The icing on the cake was when my students came out with their first brilliant piece, the teachers there became more suspicious and doubted if it was really done by the students or if it was me who drew for them.They stood there in the class by themselves to believe in what they were seeing.</p>

                        <p>Now my kids have progressed fantastically and eyebrows now raise out of amazement. Until they came to my class, the kids didn't know they could draw or play easily with colors. It was more than satisfying when we help people recognize their own strengths. The kids broke stereotypes and showed everyone that art is a language everyone can speak.

                        	<p>It is quite a challenge to balance studies, social life, volunteering and not to forget my dearest buddy laziness! But the whole experience of volunteering is beautiful, it keeps me going.</p>
						<p>This is just a start, I'm looking forward to see smiles on many more kids and even run an institute in future for free. After all, life is complete and beautiful when we live not only for us but for others too. </p>
