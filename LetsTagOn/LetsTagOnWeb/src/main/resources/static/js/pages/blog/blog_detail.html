                        <h2>Volunteering gives me a deep sense of purpose</h2>

                            Volunteering has been my passion right from school and working at Infosys has helped develop that interest further. Working with the community to facilitate a larger social development is part of the Infosys culture and this has been deeply ingrained in the ethos of the corporation and amplified through actions championed by the leaders themselves. The Team of Samarpan (CSR Wing of Bangalore DC, Infosys) provides a platform for employees to engage in volunteering at the DC level. Samarpan has great potential and the promise of nurturing responsible citizens for tomorrow who will fuel sustainable change. My association with Samarpan as a volunteer over the last eight years has been a life-changing experience and denying the comfort and luxury of home to volunteer to distant places that require timely help provides an exhilarating and overwhelming exposure. Being a volunteer has always helped me make new friends and expand my social network and has given me the opportunity to practice and develop social skills. It has also given me a deep sense of purpose and has increased my self-confidence. I have been part of many projects and I talk about couple of them below. ‘Parishudha’ is Project driven towards improving sanitary solutions in villages. This is an Infosys foundation initiative supported by our Samarpan group. Open defecation is a problem that must be addressed aggressively across the entire nation and today, this initiative is a success story that holds the promise of a cleaner, healthier India. Infosys’ professional approach to this initiative has made it easier for other organizations to step in and replicate this model of working with local communities to achieve fixed goals. With this initiative, more than 10,000 families have constructed toilets in five districts of Northern Karnataka; Gulbarga, Bidar, Yadgir, Koppal and Raichur. The Parishudha initiative has won praise and recognition from several quarters and the Infosys team was invited to share their best practices with the state governments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, the Government of India, the United Nations Developmental Program and several other forums. From the start, the aim of the program was to make this initiative easily replicable, so that communities across India can adapt and implement such measures and achieve 100% sanitation.
